# RPG Deck Godot Spike

This directory is a minimal executable boundary spike for loading RPG Deck Project JSON in Godot.

It is not the canonical authoring source. RPG Deck Project JSON remains the source of truth in `packages/core-domain` and the editor. This spike consumes copied project JSON and should not save data back to RPG Deck.

Non-goals for this skeleton:

* no bidirectional editing
* no schema fork
* no full game implementation
* no map rendering yet
* no player movement yet
* no command execution yet
* no saved fixture JSON committed in this step

## Manual Setup

1. Open the RPG Deck editor.
2. Confirm the current project JSON with `Preview Project JSON` if needed.
3. Copy the current project JSON from the editor's `Project JSON` section.
4. Place the copied JSON manually at `godot_spike/data/project.json`.
5. Open `godot_spike` in Godot.
6. Run the project.
7. Confirm the loader logs project id, title, start map, start position, map count, and event count.

If `data/project.json` is missing, the loader should report a clear warning and not crash.

## Manual Verification

1. Copy Project JSON from the RPG Deck editor.
2. Place it at `godot_spike/data/project.json`.
3. Open `godot_spike` in Godot.
4. Run the project.
5. Confirm the output logs:
   * project id
   * project title
   * start map
   * start position
   * map count
   * event count
   * current map size
   * current map collision count
   * current map event count
6. Rename or remove `data/project.json`.
7. Run the project again.
8. Confirm the missing-file warning appears and the project does not crash.

## Current Skeleton

The committed `scenes/ProjectLoaderScene.tscn` is the configured main scene. It only runs `ProjectLoader.cs` on a plain `Node`.

`ProjectLoader.cs` only reads, parses, extracts first-loader summary data, and logs a project summary. It now includes current map size, current map collision count, and current map event count. Map rendering, player movement, collision behavior, event interaction, and command execution are intentionally left for later Phase 11 steps.

Godot may create local generated files such as `.godot/`, `.csproj`, `.sln`, or other local files while opening or running the project. Do not commit generated files unless a later task explicitly approves them.
